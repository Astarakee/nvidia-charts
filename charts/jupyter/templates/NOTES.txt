To reach the matlab container do a port-forward to expose the port on your computer

  kubectl port-forward service/{{ include "common.names.fullname" . }} 8888:8888

Check the logs of pod for an url like "http://hostname:8888/?token=examplerandomsecret"

Replace "http://hostname:8888" with "http://localhost:8888" in the url and connect your webbrowser to it.


When you are done for today remove the pod and the usage of the GPU with:

  kubectl scale deployment {{ include "common.names.fullname" . }} --replicas=0

If you are done, and want to remove all data etc, do an:

  helm uninstall {{ .Release.Name }}
