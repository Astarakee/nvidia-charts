To reach the matlab container do a port-forward to expose the port on your computer

  kubectl port-forward service/{{ include "common.names.fullname" . }} 8080:6080

After that connect a webbrowser to:

http://localhost:8080/

And login with the default password 'matlab'

When you are done for today remove the pod and the usage of the GPU with:

  kubectl scale deployment {{ include "common.names.fullname" . }} --replicas=0

If you are done, and want to remove all data etc, do an:

  helm uninstall {{ .Release.Name }}
